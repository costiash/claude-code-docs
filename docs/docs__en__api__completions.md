# Completions

## Create

**post** `/v1/complete`

[Legacy] Create a Text Completion.

The Text Completions API is a legacy API. We recommend using the [Messages API](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/messages) going forward.

Future models and features will not be compatible with Text Completions. See our [migration guide](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/migrating-from-text-completions-to-messages) for guidance in migrating from Text Completions to Messages.

  - `UnionMember1 = string`

- `prompt: string`

  The prompt that you want Claude to complete.

  For proper response generation you will need to format your prompt using alternating `

  Human:`and`

  Assistant:` conversational turns. For example:

  ```
  "
  
  Human: {userQuestion}
  
  Assistant:"
  ```

  See [prompt validation](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/prompt-validation) and our guide to [prompt design](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/intro-to-prompting) for more details.

- `metadata: optional Metadata`

  An object describing metadata about the request.

  - `user_id: optional string`

    An external identifier for the user who is associated with the request.

    This should be a uuid, hash value, or other opaque identifier. Anthropic may use this id to help detect abuse. Do not include any identifying information such as name, email address, or phone number.

- `stop_sequences: optional array of string`

  Sequences that will cause the model to stop generating.

  Our models stop on `"

  Human:"`, and may include additional built-in stop sequences in the future. By providing the stop_sequences parameter, you may include additional strings that will cause the model to stop generating.

- `stream: optional boolean`

  Whether to incrementally stream the response using server-sent events.

  See [streaming](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/streaming) for details.

- `temperature: optional number`

  Amount of randomness injected into the response.

  Defaults to `1.0`. Ranges from `0.0` to `1.0`. Use `temperature` closer to `0.0` for analytical / multiple choice, and closer to `1.0` for creative and generative tasks.

  Note that even with `temperature` of `0.0`, the results will not be fully deterministic.

- `top_k: optional number`

  Only sample from the top K options for each subsequent token.

  Used to remove "long tail" low probability responses. [Learn more technical details here](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-sample-from-language-models-682bceb97277).

  Recommended for advanced use cases only.

- `top_p: optional number`

  Use nucleus sampling.

  In nucleus sampling, we compute the cumulative distribution over all the options for each subsequent token in decreasing probability order and cut it off once it reaches a particular probability specified by `top_p`.

  Recommended for advanced use cases only.

### Returns

- `Completion = object { id, completion, model, 2 more }`

  - `id: string`

    The format and length of IDs may change over time.

  - `completion: string`

    The model that will complete your prompt.

    See [models](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/models-overview) for additional details and options.
