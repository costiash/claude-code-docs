## Archive Tunnel

**post** `/v1/organizations/tunnels/{tunnel_id}/archive`

**Deprecated.** This Admin API endpoint is superseded by `/v1/tunnels` on the Claude API and will be removed after a migration window. New integrations should use [`/v1/tunnels`](/docs/en/api/beta/tunnels) with the `anthropic-beta: mcp-tunnels-2026-06-22` header and a WIF token carrying the `workspace:manage_tunnels` scope. Existing integrations continue to work with the `mcp-tunnels-2026-05-19` header and `org:manage_tunnels` scope during the migration window.

Archive a tunnel. Archival is irreversible.

Every non-archived certificate on the tunnel is archived in the same
operation, the hostname is retired and never re-allocated, and the
tunnel token is invalidated. Retrying against an already-archived
tunnel returns the existing record unchanged.

### Path Parameters

- `tunnel_id: string`

  ID of the Tunnel.

### Header Parameters

- `"anthropic-beta": array of "mcp-tunnels-2026-05-19"`

  Required for all Tunnel endpoints.

  - `"mcp-tunnels-2026-05-19"`

### Returns

- `id: string`

  ID of the Tunnel.

- `archived_at: string`

  RFC 3339 datetime string indicating when the Tunnel was archived, or
  `null` if it is not archived.

- `created_at: string`

  RFC 3339 datetime string indicating when the Tunnel was created.

- `display_name: string`

  Human-readable name for the Tunnel (1–255 characters), or `null` if unset.

- `domain: string`

  Anthropic-assigned hostname for the Tunnel. MCP server URLs whose host is a
  subdomain of this value are routed through the Tunnel. Globally unique and
  never reused, even after the Tunnel is archived.

- `type: "tunnel"`

  Object type. Always `tunnel` for Tunnels.

  - `"tunnel"`

- `workspace_id: string`

  ID of the Workspace this Tunnel belongs to, or `null` for the default
  Workspace. Immutable after creation.

### Example

curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/tunnels/$TUNNEL_ID/archive \
    -X POST \
